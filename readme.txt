Add a Log In and Log Out link to your navigation menu.

== Description ==
 
This simple plugin makes your life easier by adding a login and logout link to your navigation menu out of the box. It adds a login link with a "Log in" text to your navigation menu automatically if logged out, it changes to a "log out" text with a logout link with WordPress nonce if logged in. Which means you won't run to a WordPress warning while trying to logout from a custom logout link again.

1. Install the plugin and activate it, no further action is required.
